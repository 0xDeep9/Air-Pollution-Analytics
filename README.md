# **Problem Statement**

To determine the right product-market fit for an air purifier in India, key questions needed to be answered:

### **Air Quality Assessment**

* Which cities face the highest pollution levels (AQI)?
* How has air quality changed over time?
* What pollutants dominate (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂)?

### **Seasonal & Trend Behavior**

* Which months show critical spikes in pollution?
* How do AQI patterns correlate with weather or festivals (e.g., Diwali)?

### **Public Demand & Awareness**

* Are people searching more for terms like *“air purifier”, “AQI today”, “N95 mask”*?
* How does demand vary regionally and seasonally?

### **Market Opportunity**

* Which cities show both *high pollution* and *high consumer interest*?
* What is the potential launch priority ranking?

### **Competitor Benchmarking**

* How do current brands (Dyson, Philips, Xiaomi, Honeywell) perform?
* What features, technologies, and price brackets dominate the market?

### **Feature Gap Identification**

* Which features are missing in existing models?
* What can be added to make AirPure’s product stand out?

# **Air Quality Analysis**

A detailed Power BI dashboard was created to explore India's air quality landscape across 400+ cities.

### **Total Cities Analyzed:**

📌 *400+ major and minor cities* across India were included.

### **AQI Severity Overview:**

* A significant portion of cities fall into **Poor**, **Very Poor**, or **Severe** categories.
* Northern cities show consistently higher pollution due to dust load, industrial activity, and winter inversions.

### **Top Polluted Cities:**

Delhi NCR, Ghaziabad, Kanpur, Lucknow, Mumbai suburbs dominate the severe AQI list.

### **AQI Trend Analysis:**

* AQI declines drastically during **winter months (Nov–Jan)**.
* A sharp spike is observed around **Diwali** across multiple years.

---

# **Pollutant Breakdown & Seasonal Trends**

### **Dominant Pollutants:**

* **PM2.5** and **PM10** are the major contributors to poor air quality.
* NO₂ and SO₂ show increased concentration in industrial regions.

### **Key Seasonal Insights:**

* PM2.5 peaks in **winter** due to stagnant air and emissions.
* Coastal cities show lower overall AQI but occasional rises due to traffic density and humidity.

### **Pollution by City Type:**

* Metro cities show **highest PM2.5 correlation** with population density.
* Industrial clusters show **NO₂ dominance**.

---

# **Google Trends Demand Analysis**

To gauge consumer readiness, Google Trends data for 5 years was analyzed.

### **Key Findings:**

* Searches for **“air purifier”** surge by 60–200% in winter months.
* High search interest seen in **Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune, Hyderabad**.
* Rising interest in **N95 masks** post-COVID boosts purifier awareness.
* Rural regions show low awareness → low immediate demand.

---

# **Market Opportunity & City Prioritization**

A **Market Opportunity Index** was created using:

* AQI level
* Seasonal variation intensity
* Google Trends interest
* Consumer purchasing power
* Competition density

### **Top High-Potential Cities:**

1. **Delhi NCR**
2. **Mumbai**
3. **Bengaluru**
4. **Pune**
5. **Hyderabad**
6. **Lucknow**
7. **Patna**

These cities show *high pollution + high demand + strong retail infrastructure*.

# **Competitor Benchmarking**

Brands analyzed: **Dyson, Philips, Xiaomi, Honeywell, Coway, Sharp**

### **Key Insights:**

* **Dyson** dominates premium segment with advanced filtration.
* **Philips & Xiaomi** dominate mid-range with HEPA filters.
* Budget segment lacks **smart features** and **real-time AQI monitoring**.
* Very few products offer **filter life prediction**, **mobile app control**, or **child lock** at mid-range prices.

---

# **Feature Gap Matrix**

A competitive feature matrix was constructed.

### **Missed Features in Current Market:**

* Affordable models lack **real-time AQI display**.
* Very few offer **filter-life monitoring**.
* Limited models support **smartphone integration**.
* Automatic mode performance varies widely.
* Most budget models lack **activated carbon + HEPA combo** together.

### **Opportunity:**

AirPure can dominate mid-range by adding *smart + safety + efficient* features at an optimal price.
