# Air-Pollution-Analytics
India is one of the most pollution-affected countries globally, making air quality a critical public-health and consumer-market concern.
AirPure Innovations needed to determine:

Where to launch their air purifier

Who their early adopters would be

Which features matter most to customers

How they compare to existing competitors

To solve this, I built a fully navigable insight-rich dashboard and performed both Primary & Secondary analysis to answer 12 complex business questions.

**📊 What I Did**
✔ 1. Identified top cities with worsening AQI trends

Analyzed multi-year AQI data to classify cities into high-risk, moderate-risk, and rising-risk segments.

✔ 2. Correlated pollution patterns with health impact

Connected AQI trends with publicly available respiratory illness data to quantify exposure risk.

✔ 3. Analyzed public interest via Google Trends

Studied search patterns for keywords like “air purifier”, “AQI today”, and “N95 mask” to understand demand readiness.

✔ 4. Benchmarked major competitors

Mapped features, pricing, and technology used by top players (Dyson, Philips, Xiaomi, etc.).

✔ 5. Created a Feature Gap Matrix

Identified missing functionalities in competitor products and opportunities for AirPure Innovations.

✔ 6. Built a City-wise Market Priority Strategy

Ranked Indian cities based on pollution severity, demand interest, competitor density, and purchasing power.
