# Air-Pollution-Analytics
India is one of the most pollution-affected countries globally, making air quality a critical public-health and consumer-market concern.

AirPure Innovations needed to determine:

Where to launch their air purifier

Who their early adopters would be

Which features matter most to customers

How they compare to existing competitors

To solve this, I built a fully navigable insight-rich dashboard and performed both Primary & Secondary analysis to answer 12 complex business questions.

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

The following questions were answered using the primary datasets provided from the Dataful platform, focusing on AQI, health impact, vehicle data, and population projections.

1️⃣ List the top 5 and bottom 5 areas with highest average AQI  
📅 December 2024 to May 2025  

2️⃣ Identify top 2 and bottom 2 pollutants in Southern Indian states  
📅 Post-COVID (2022 onward)  

3️⃣ Compare AQI on weekends vs weekdays across Indian metros  
📅 Last 1 year  

4️⃣ Identify months with consistently poor air quality in top 10 states  
📍 Based on high distinct areas  

5️⃣ Categorize Bengaluru’s air quality days from March–May 2025  

6️⃣ Most reported disease illnesses per state + avg AQI  
📅 Past 3 years  

7️⃣ Top 5 states with highest EV adoption vs average AQI  
📅 2022–2025

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following questions required additional research, external data integration, and behavioral analysis beyond the core AQI dataset.


1️⃣ Which age group is most affected by air pollution-related health outcomes — and how does this vary by city?  

2️⃣ Who are the major competitors in the Indian air purifier market, and what are their key differentiators (e.g., price, filtration stages, smart features)?  

3️⃣ What is the relationship between a city’s population size and its average AQI — do larger cities always suffer from worse air quality?  
📅 Uses 2024 AQI and population projections  

4️⃣ How aware are Indian citizens of what AQI means — and do they understand its health implications?  
📊 Based on Google Trends  `

**📊 What I Did**

✔ 1. Identified top cities with worsening AQI trends

Analyzed multi-year AQI data to classify cities into high-risk, moderate-risk, and rising-risk segments.

✔ 2. Correlated pollution patterns with health impact

Connected AQI trends with publicly available respiratory illness data to quantify exposure risk.

✔ 3. Analyzed public interest via Google Trends

Studied search patterns for keywords like “air purifier”, “AQI today”, and “N95 mask” to understand demand readiness.

✔ 4. Benchmarked major competitors

Mapped features, pricing, and technology used by top players (Dyson, Philips, Xiaomi, etc.).

✔ 5. Created a Feature Gap Matrix

Identified missing functionalities in competitor products and opportunities for AirPure Innovations.

✔ 6. Built a City-wise Market Priority Strategy

Ranked Indian cities based on pollution severity, demand interest, competitor density, and purchasing power.
