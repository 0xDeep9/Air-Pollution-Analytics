# Air-Pollution-Analytics

# **Objective of the Project**

The objective of this project is to perform an end-to-end data-driven analysis of India’s air quality, consumer interest, and competitive landscape to guide AirPure Innovations in:

* Selecting the right cities for product launch
* Understanding pollution severity and seasonality
* Identifying high-demand consumer segments
* Analyzing competitor strengths and gaps
* Recommending product features based on user needs

The insights from this project provide a **strategic roadmap** for AirPure’s market entry.

# Insights Covered in the Dashboard

**1. Top and bottom AQI areas**

* The first part of the analysis looked at pollution levels between December 2024 and May 2025. Cities like Byrnihat, Delhi, and Hajipur showed extremely high average AQI, while places like Tirunelveli and Madikeri remained consistently clean. This helped identify potential high-demand zones for purifiers.

**2. Prominent pollutants in Southern Indian states**

* Using post-COVID data from 2022 onward, I identified that PM10 and PM2.5 remain the dominant pollutants across Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Telangana. This reinforced the need for strong particulate filtration features.

**3. Weekday vs weekend AQI patterns**

* By comparing weekday and weekend AQI in major metros, I found that most cities showed noticeable improvement on weekends. This suggests that traffic and industrial activity contribute heavily to weekday pollution levels.

**4. Monthly AQI patterns across top states**

* A heatmap and trend chart revealed that November to January consistently record the worst AQI across top states. This seasonal spike is important for planning marketing campaigns and stocking strategies.

**5. Bengaluru’s air quality distribution**

<img width="1255" height="659" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecd5d1b8-8954-4239-9832-99e82b7724cd" />

* I analysed data from March to May 2025 to see how often Bengaluru falls into different AQI categories. Most days were rated satisfactory, with a smaller proportion falling into the moderate category. This indicates that Bengaluru may serve as a future expansion market rather than a primary-one.

**6. Disease burden vs AQI**

<img width="1278" height="719" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2125b9e8-c696-4b8d-b336-d999f57d31cb" />

* Using the last three years of health data, I identified the most reported diseases per state and compared them with average AQI levels. States with higher AQI tend to report more respiratory illnesses like URTI and pneumonia, highlighting the public health relevance of pollution.

**7. EV adoption vs AQI**

<img width="1220" height="636" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e21a9ef-bcd2-425f-a9ad-5bece2ba0c45" />

* I compared the top five EV-adopting states with average AQI levels from 2022 to 2025. The results showed that high EV adoption does not always correlate with lower pollution, suggesting that electric vehicles alone cannot reverse poor air quality.

# Recommendations for Product Launch

**1. Introduce Smart HEPA Air Purifier**

* With real-time AQI display, app control, and automatic mode.

**2. Target High-Risk Cities First**

* Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune, Hyderabad.

**3. Provide Subscription-Based Filter Replacement**

* Encourages long-term customer retention.

**4. Offer Family & Child-Safe Features**

* Essential due to rising pollution impact on children.

**5. Launch Seasonal Marketing Campaigns**

* Peak demand months: October–January

**6. Price-Optimized Model Strategy**

Create 2–3 variants:

* Budget Smart Model

* Mid-Range Smart HEPA Model

* Premium Activated Carbon + HEPA Combo
